In many domains, structured data and unstructured text are
important natural resources to fuel data analysis. Statistical
text analysis needs to be performed over the text data to extract
structured information for further query processing. Typically, developers
will connect multiple tools to build
off-line batch processes to perform analysis tasks. \system is
an integrated system for ad hoc real-time query processing over
structured and unstructured data. \system is built along side of MADlib,
over PostgreSQL and Greenplum DBMS. \system includes a library of 
textual analytic functions and it integrates in-database text 
extraction techniques from BayesStore. To illustrate our system, this 
demonstration uses two application domains---computation journalism 
and political campaign management---to show (1) declarative  processing of ad 
hoc queries involving statistical text analysis; 
(2) joining between structured and textual data; and (3) query-time rendering of
visualizations over the query result.
