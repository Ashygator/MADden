In many domains, structured data and unstructured text are
both important natural resources to fuel data analysis. Statistical
text analysis needs to be performed over the text data to extract
structured information for further query processing. Common practice
in industry requires developers to connect multiple tools to build
off-line batch processes to perform such analysis tasks. \system is
an integrated system for ad hoc real-time query processing over
structured and unstructured data. \system is built on top of MADlib,
and PostgreSQL/Greenplum, and integrates in-database text extraction
techniques from BayesStore. This demonstration uses two application
domains---computation journalism and political campaign
management---to show (1) real-time processing of ad hoc queries
involving statistical text analysis; (2) joining between structured
and textual data; and (3) query-time rendering of
visualizations over the query result.
