There are existing techniques to add text analytics inside of 
traditional databases \cite{Jain:2009:BQO:1519103.1519108, Li:2011:SDI:2002440.2002459}.
These system are mostly rule based and do not provide advanced
statistical methods.
Systems such as Hazy \cite{Koc:2011:IMC:1952376.1952380}, 
WordSeer \cite{muralidharanvisual} and 
with BayesStore \cite{Wang:2008:BML:1453856.1453896} provide statistical 
methods inside databases but none of them provide a 
comprehensive toolkit of techniques for querying text within a single query.
