The demand for large scale textual analytics has turned into an necessity for
many industries. However, for companies with large scale relational databases,
the adoption of sufficient large scale analytics may be cumbersome and 
expensive.
We demonstrate a database system that natively supports information extraction,
entity resolution methods, topic modeling, and classification over text.
We take advantage of the query to reduce the search space and execute an
efficient query plan. 
We show multiple textual analysis tasks in an example application domain
that normally would be more cumbersome to perform difficult.
Additionally, we show \system's adbvantages over traditional approaches.
