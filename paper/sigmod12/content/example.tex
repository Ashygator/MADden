\section{Example Query}

In this example query we demonstrate the flexibility and multi-modal 
support of \system. The example query is shown in following Query:
%\ref{quote:main}


\begin{quotation}

Give me the \underline{best} new involving the \underline{Arizona Cardinals} 
team and involving the player \underline{Larry Fitzgerald}.

%\caption{Plain text Query}
%\label{quote:main}
\end{quotation}


Notice the query has three parameters expressed as underlines.
The parameter `best' here refers to a ratio of good news to bad news.
`Arizona Cardinals' is a professional American Football team in the National
Football League (NFL) and `Larry Fitzgerald' is a player for that team.

To answer this query, we assume we are given tables\footnote{In {\system} these
tables may be extracted before hand, or defined over a foreign data wrapper}
with the following schema:

\begin{quotation}
Player(id, name, ...)

PlayerAlias(pid, nickname)

Team(id, name, city)

TeamAlias(teamid, nickname)

BlogEntry(id, entry, title, posted\_at)

Recaps(id, team1, team2, date, text) $\leftarrow$ not needed

Plays(id, playnum, team1, team2, date, text) $\leftarrow$ not needed
\end{quotation}
