\section{Example Query}

In this example query we demonstrate the flexibility and multi-modal 
support of \system. The example query is shown in Query \ref{quote:main}


\begin{quotation}

Give me the \underline{best} new involving the \underline{Arizona Cardinals} 
team and involving the player \underline{Larry Fitzgerald}.

\caption{Plain text Query}
\label{quote:main}
\end{quotation}


Notice Query \ref{quote:main} has three parameters expressed as underlines.
The parameter `best' here refers to a ratio of good news to bad news.
`Arizona Cardinals' is a professional American Football team in the National
Football League (NFL) and `Larry Fitzgerald' is a player for that team.

To answer this query, we assume we are given tables\footnote{In \system these
tables may be extracted before hand, or defined over a foreign data wrapper}
with the following schema:

\begin{quotation}
Player(id, name, ...)

PlayerAlias(pid, nickname)

Team(id, name, city)

TeamAlias(teamid, nickname)

BlogEntry(id, entry, title, posted\_at)

Recaps(id, team1, team2, date, text) \leftarrow not needed

Plays(id, playnum, team1, team2, date, text) \leftarrow not needed
\end{quotation}


To answer this query using a program such as R we would need to ....

Using an analytics language such as R or Matlab supports a large number of 
statistical libraries.

For some corporations, sampling data is not enough.

Difficult to adopt, must wait to get data
