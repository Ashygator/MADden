\section{Introduction}

In this paper we describe a \system, a system that allows advanced querying
over structured and unstructured data. Beyond standard spj queries we
demonstrate the Inference techniques using native database techniques.
Additionally, we implementation is over PostgreSQL and Greenplum
parallel databases, demonstrating the scalability of our system.

Domains: Sports, Voting

Query driven is needed for adhoc analysis.
To support this over large data we need parallel algos.


In our running example we show the creation of a View over textual
data involving different textual analysis tasks.

As part of this demonstration we show that:
1) It is possible to do query time textual analytics in the database

2) Methods are scalable using parallel databases postgresql or Greenplum
