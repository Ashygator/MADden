\section{Introduction}

In this paper we describe a \system, a system that allows advanced querying
over structured and unstructured data. Beyond standard spj queries we
demonstrate the Inference techniques using native database techniques.
Additionally, we implementation is over PostgreSQL and Greenplum
parallel databases, demonstrating the scalability of our system.

In our running example we show the creation of a View over textual
data involving different textual analysis tasks.
