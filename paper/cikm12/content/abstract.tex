In many domains, structured data and unstructured text are both
important natural resources to fuel data analysis. Statistical
text analysis needs to be performed over text data to extract
structured information for further query processing. 
Typically, developers will need to connect multiple tools to build
off-line batch processes to perform text analytic tasks. \system is
an integrated system developed for relational database systems such
as PostgreSQL and Greenplum for real-time ad hoc query processing over
structured and unstructured data. 
{\system} implements four important text analytic functions that we have
contributed to the MADlib open source library for textual analytics.
In this demonstration, we will to show the capability of the MADden text 
analytic library using computational journalism as the driving application.
We show real-time declarative query processing over multiple data 
sources with both structured and text information.



\eat{To illustrate our system, this 
demonstration uses two application domains---computation journalism 
and political campaign management---to show (1) declarative  processing 
of ad hoc queries involving statistical text analysis; 
(2) joining between structured and textual data; and (3) query-time 
rendering of visualizations over the query result.}
